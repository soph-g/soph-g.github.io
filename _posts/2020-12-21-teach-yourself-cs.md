This year has been difficult in so many ways, and like many others in London I'm finishing the year with a final challenge - how to entertain myself over the Christmas period now my plans have been cancelled and I'm home alone 🥴

Thankfully I have friends living locally that I can bubble with and be with on Christmas Day.

But I now find myself with a lot more alone time than I had expected! I am off work for a couple of weeks, and my partner is now stranded abroad until February at least, so I want to treat this time alone as an opportunity to make progress on a project.

And for that project, I have chosen [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)

The 'curriculum' is divided into 9 sections, and makes use of free resources from around the web to guide you through a computer science curriculum. This is something I've wanted to start working on for a while, but I haven't made it a priority so far.

I've spent a couple of hours getting setup for the first part of the 'course' - [Programming](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#programming), and as I found that it involved a little bit of digging to find the right resources, I'm going to record some notes on the blog.

Obviously I've got some other exciting activities planned like daily walks outside, a jigsaw puzzle and working through the old GCHQ puzzle book 🤘🏻So it won't all be coding over the next couple of weeks.
