I'm finally doing it, hopefully! Migrating my blog to a site I have built and maintain myself, instead of being tied to Wordpress.

Wordpress is great if you're just getting started blogging, and want to get setup quickly and easily. But if you're looking for a bit more freedom and creativity in your blog, and want to DIY it, then Jekyll is a great next step.

Right now the site is pretty basic and not deployed, so there are a few things on my to do list:

1. Deploy this basic site to GitHub pages
2. Setup my custom domain for the site
3. Switch to a prettier theme
4. Carry on blogging!

Wish me luck 🍀
