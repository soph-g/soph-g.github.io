It's a new year, and I'm starting it with a few changes in progress - December ended up being a whirlwind of activity!

The biggest change by far is that I'm leaving [Makers](). I've been coaching for two years now, and it's definitely time for a change. I've got my next job lined up so I'll share more details once I've started, but for now it's enough to know that I'm going back to web development and couldn't be happier :)

I'm also working on a whole host of small changes by re-committing to the habits I want to have in my life.

As I move back into a developer role I've also decided to go on my own educational adventure - I'm going to start a part-time Computer Science BSc.

My first modules will start in April, and I am hoping to complete the degree in 5 years. It's a fully remote course, so it can fit around my life, and it's also one of the first of it's kind.
