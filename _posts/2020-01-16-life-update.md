It's a new year, and I'm starting it with a few changes in progress - December ended up being a whirlwind of activity!

The biggest change by far is that I'm leaving [Makers](). I've been coaching for two years now, and it's definitely time for a change. I've got my next job lined up so I'll share more details once I've started, but for now it's enough to know that I'm going back to web development and couldn't be happier :)

I'm also working on a whole host of small changes by re-committing to the habits I want to have in my life.

Towards the end of 2019 I decided to do a reflection on my year, and where I want to go in 2020. I picked the weekend of the winter solstice for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it's the shortest and therefore darkest day of the year - perfect for staying inside and getting cosy. Secondly, it marks the very depths of winter, and the turning point at which we start to move (slowly) towards spring.

I've tried to do this several times in the past but usually end up overwhelmed and give up. This time I broke my review into 6 different areas, plus a big picture review.

1. Relationships
2. Work
3. Money
4. Hobbies
5. Environment
6. Self-care
7. Big Picture

As a result of this review I identified a few things I want to do this year:

- Find the fun in blogging again
- Go back to school
- Make self-care a part of my routine
