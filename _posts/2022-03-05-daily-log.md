I'm starting a new job on Monday, and have had the luxury of ~10 days off since leaving Cleo. The past 12 months have been unbelievably stressful in my own life, even before taking into account living through a pandemic, and now a war in Europe.

_I stand with Ukraine üá∫üá¶ üíô üíõ, it's hard not to feel overwhelmed by the unfolding situation. If you have the means, consider donating to [Unicef](https://www.unicef.org.uk/donate/donate-now-to-protect-children-in-ukraine/) or [The Red Cross](https://donate.redcross.org.uk/appeal/ukraine-crisis-appeal)_

To avoid complete overwhelm, I took the opportunity to read, wind down, and really think about what I want to achieve in my first few months in my next job.

In times like these, I find it most useful to hide myself away a little, and indulge my bookworm tendencies üêõ

## Reading

I've recently subscribed to a few newsletters and am so far enjoying them all:

- [The Imperfectionist](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/the-imperfectionist) by Oliver Burkeman for thoughtful reflections on modern life.
- I struggle to stay on top of tech news, [TLDR](https://tldr.tech/) has really helped with this.
- [The Pragmatic Engineer](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/) is great for software engineering specific news and thought-pieces

_I've been struggling to read as many blogs as I should, or to write in my own little corner of the web, maybe creating a newsletter would help me form the habit? Also, the demise of Google Reader was big contributing factor in me giving up blog reading. If I can't find an alternative, maybe I should build one üôÉ_

I've also been reading [Staff Engineer](https://staffeng.com/book) by Will Larson. I'm at least a few years away from Staff Engineer level, and not yet sure where I'll go after I've gotten what I want out of a mid/senior software engineer role. But I've so far found this book to be a great introduction to the role, and some of the tips will no doubt be useful in the near future.

## Listening

I'd somehow completely forgotten about [Criminal](https://thisiscriminal.com), but came back to it with a lovely episode about [Masquerade](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1133587.Masquerade), a book I was obsessed with as a child.

First time listen for me, to [Not Overthinking](https://notoverthinking.com/), and the latest episode discussing [The Pathless Path](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60151185-the-pathless-path) was probably a great start for me. My career has taken many twists and turns, but overall I've found that I do better when I focus on short-term goals, together with self-knowledge, and trust the process to take care of the rest.

As I've matured I've realised that I needed to add a financial plan into the mix, to avoid continually re-starting my life and allow me to reach life goals as well as career milestones.

## Watching

Nothing tech-related here! In stressful times, my version of comfort watching involves lots of quiet, calm youtube videos.

The Sounds of Camping series by [Go4x4](https://www.youtube.com/c/go4x4media) is so soothing, and I love seeing the beauty and variety of Australia. It makes me want to go back soon!

I only recently discovered that I enjoy Studio Ghibli films, [My Neighbour Totoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Neighbor_Totoro) is now one of my all time favourite films. The first 30 minutes in particular are really special.
