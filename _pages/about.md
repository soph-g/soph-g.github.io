# Hi, I'm Sophie...

I'm a Technical Coach at [Makers](http://makers.tech) in London, where I help people on their journey into professional web development.

This blog is where I share my thoughts on web development and learning to code. It's a work in progress at the moment but ~~done~~ *deployed* is better than perfect :)
